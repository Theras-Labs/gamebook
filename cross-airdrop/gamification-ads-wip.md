# Gamification Ads \[WIP]

The game also serves as an AIRDROP gateway for supported networks.

Not only that, since we accept external NFTs or people airdrop their NFT to the game. This creates a new level of marketing system that effectively reaches active targets, as the game can gather additional information such as geographical location for distribution purposes compared to the original blind-airdrop without getting metrics or information of the recipient. Consequently, this will attract a mass AIRDROP from numerous chains to STAR-EX too. It won't depend or bound with a single chain. Player can get airdrop from a lot of chain networks.
