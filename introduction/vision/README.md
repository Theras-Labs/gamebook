# Vision

The current landscape of web3 games is often overly focused on investment and the play-to-earn model. In contrast, STAR-EX prioritizes addictive gameplay and user enjoyment, aiming to create a true masterpiece.

Our team shares this vision, focusing on bringing fresh ideas and innovative gameplay mechanics. Many existing games are too similar in their approach, lacking originality. We educate our team to understand that blockchain is primarily used for monetization in STAR-EX. While there are incentive features, they exist to give back to the community; this game is not just about investment, but mystery and thrilled.

Although we utilize cryptocurrency, our approach is unique. STAR-EX is connected in a different way and still using a hybrid system, therefore our system won't be fully influenced by Bitcoin's movement. There are multiple ways to achieve sustainability, but what matters most is player satisfaction. The most sustainable way to keep a game alive is by ensuring players keep coming back to play.
