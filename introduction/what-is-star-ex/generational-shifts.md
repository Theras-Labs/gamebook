# Generational Shifts

The gaming landscape is inextricably tied to generational shifts. Newer generations, born into the age of mobile devices and instant gratification, demand action-packed combat, and engaging gameplay experiences. They define the future of gaming, determining which games become viral and popular. The design and mechanics of modern games reflect this change. Developers now prioritize intuitive controls, shorter but more intense gaming sessions, and a continuous stream of content updates to keep players engaged.

Older Generations: A Different Perspective Conversely, older generation often seek nostalgia or investment opportunities within the gaming space. They prefer games with economic and strategic depth. This generational gap has profound implications for game design and player engagement. This leads to a fundamental issue currently plaguing the game-fi industry. Many blockchain games are gravitating towards MMORPG formats, often merely replicating existing games with little creative innovation. They focus on elements like crafting, but the overall approach lacks originality.&#x20;

However, most venture capitalists and investors still show interest in these projects, primarily concentrating on products close to completion. Their investment often seems to be more about fueling their own ecosystem's quick growth rather than fostering genuine creativity. This approach may lead to a brief surge in popularity, followed by an inevitable decline as the initial hype fades, resulting in a cycle of unsustainable games. Such patterns raise questions about the long-term viability and sustainability of these products.
