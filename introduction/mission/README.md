# Mission

We aim to be a unique cross-gameplay, cross-chain, cross-platform, cross-dimensional, and cross-community game that fosters collaboration between major networks and smaller networks, facilitating mutual interaction and growth. The game also serves as an airdrop gateway for supported networks, offering a new and effective marketing system for blockchain projects.

\
Furthermore, the game ultimately emphasizes collaboration between veteran chains and rookie chains. Mainly to foster community integration and event collaboration, so each network chain will be in a win-win situation as long as they are in our game ecosystem. As we aim to become the premier esports entertainment platform among blockchain, where all chains can compete or collaborate in events within our game, only the network chains that don't join the brawl will lose out on the opportunity.

Even the rookie blockchains can attract more community to try their chain, while the veteran blockchains will gain new players and transactions to further congest their ecosystem to the max! ðŸ¤£ The game will push other blockchain fanatic to try other ecosystem based on our event and analysis.
