# Progressive Development

Our commitment to progressive game development unfolds in carefully planned stages, ensuring continuity and depth in our space-themed universe. Players don't need to wait for full game as we release our feature step by step.

Starting with mini-game (simulation), then expeditions, arena, and continue to deep space race exploration, we leverage existing assets and mechanics, seamlessly transitioning to multiplayer dynamics, where alliances and competition take center stage.&#x20;

Building on this foundation, by reusing and optimizing assets across phases, we maintain a cohesive space theme and provide players with a diverse, evolving gaming experience that keeps them engaged throughout their journey in the STAR-EX universe.

The game will never be completed, it always evolve.
