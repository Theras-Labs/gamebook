# Exploration

Before embarking on explorations, players must graduate from the simulations and obtain an NFT adventurer license. However, this pass can also be traded or acquired from other players, as everything in STAR-EX is an NFT.

Explorations will take place in different zones and can be played solo or with team members, depending on the ship's capabilities. In this reality, players will face challenges similar to the zone simulations but with slightly better item drops. Players can lose their spaceship here and will encounter monsters and anomaly events. They can also discover and mint planets (refer to the Zone and Economic sections for more details).



Exploration zones include:

* Outposts
* Planets
* Dungeons
