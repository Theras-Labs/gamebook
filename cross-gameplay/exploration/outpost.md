# Outpost

Outposts are where players start or spawn in the game. This initial zone allows players to explore space first. Players need to prepare their exploration gear, as survival depends on finding other outposts or habitable planets. Outposts serve as crucial waypoints and safe havens for players venturing into the vastness of space. \<check nft-zone>
