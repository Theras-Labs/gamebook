# Arena

Within Planet and Outpost, there will be a room or place to do practices but also a competition arena.&#x20;

This mode features a thrilling racing competition similar to Mario Kart or CTR, but with the added excitement of three-dimensional movement, allowing spaceships to fly and race in all directions.

Players can also participate in secluded arena racing on custom-made tracks. This mode allows players to become esports athletes and engage in ranked matchmaking. Each network chain will eventually select their top athletes to represent their network in competitions.
