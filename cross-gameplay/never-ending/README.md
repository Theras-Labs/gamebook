# Never Ending

While we've already implemented several gameplays, the resources we are currently building for the current gameplay are also aimed at preparing for the next future gameplay ( skill effects, procedural generation, and ship trajectory, etc).&#x20;

Our roadmap extends over the next 3-5 years, considering the pace of our team's progress. As an indie developer, we began with a single person managing nearly all aspects, from coding the blockchain to game development. Therefore, our strategy involves building easier and smaller-scale developments first (mini-games, arenas, etc) to more advance gameplay later. This is to achieve our goals step by step realistically. Which obviously the gameplay will always around the 3D.

Who knows when there's new idea, we can implemented it faster.
