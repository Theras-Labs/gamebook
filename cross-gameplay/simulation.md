# Simulation

Representing the concept of exploration challenges, players will collect points and experience, with most challenges depending on the zone. In this section, there's also option of on-chain gaming events that players can participate in. Players can also obtain limited items from simulations based on the reserved supply of resource control. The obstacle challenges here mostly will use procedural generation.

Players can also engage in matchmaking against other players. (This feature will be available once the community grows sufficiently.)
