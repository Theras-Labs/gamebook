# On Chain Gaming \[WIP]

This is actually an event, and thus it will not be an NFT too at the beginning because it will be harder and complicated bringing new player.

On-Chain gaming basically provide everything to interact with smart contract.\
\
1st Feature: Player enter the game -> the amount and rarity of the rewards will be based on VRF, and to avoid bot cheat, then it will use automation programatically to do re-random again with self-logic

2rd Feature: This is mainly for streamer and best when our multiplayer is ready, so viewer can contribute to increase the level of challenges in the game ~~while also able to plant minefield and steal the resources for incentive program~~

\[TBC]
