# List Networks

The MINOR blockchains always outnumber the MAJOR blockchains. Currently, there are 6 MAJOR blockchains on the testnet:

* TRON/BTTC group
* BNB/opBNB
* Polygon/zkEVM
* Starknet
* Polkadot
* BASE

The MINOR blockchains, some of which you may not have heard of, include:

* Taraxa (delegated)
* Lisk
* Avalanche
* CrossValue
* Manta Network
* Rootstock
* Arthera
* Areon
* Nexis
* Meter
* Metis

Ideally, there will be 9-12 MAJOR chains and 24 MINOR chains, with the remaining blockchains competing in a lower league.

On the mainnet schedule, we will have these before July:

* TRON/BTTC as a MAJOR blockchain
* LISK as a MINOR blockchain



## DIFFERENCES

MAJOR BLOCKCHAINS:

* Main NFT ( Ships, Ability, etc )

* can control a zone (this will impact the future incentive, but since it will be too much information this will be introduced later to make user understand the basic)&#x20;
* can have its own planet
* can have its own governance system
* can have its own expedition unit, means open a staking pool feature.



MINOR:

* NFT Materials (higher rarity)
* NFT Tools
