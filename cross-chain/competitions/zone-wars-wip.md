# Zone Wars \[WIP]

ZONE-WAR will happen every week for a 1-day period.&#x20;

During this time, some zones will become neutral, and players need to play and claim/mint as many materials as they find in that zone within their preferred network chains.&#x20;

If players find materials they don't support during WAR, they can choose to not to claim them, or they can use the tool called claim-transporter. This tool allows players to claim materials in any network chain or a specific network chain. \*Work rarity will affect calculations.
