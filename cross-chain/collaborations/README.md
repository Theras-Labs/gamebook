A faction will have a Minor chain as its support, which will become crucial in the game.

Each zone is owned by a FACTION, and each zone has its available chain materials based on the faction's chain. However, Zone NFTs can be from any network chain. Some materials will be hidden though.

For example: This zone is currently controlled by the Polygon faction. A player who has this NFT Zone from any network chain can enter the game, but since it's controlled by Polygon, the available materials right now are only within the supported FACTION.

So, a Minor chain under a faction will eventually have material assets ready in that zone. Players entering the zone can only claim/mint materials from that faction. However, players can always use a SHIP from another network chain, even when battling with other players.

This can be helpful during WAR TIME in the competition. \<refer to ZONE WARS>
