# Factions

Unlike many web3 games that rely on a single blockchain. We aim to have each network collaborate and compete against each other purely for entertainment while still using resources from each network chain. However, managing unlimited resources and ensuring balanced competition across numerous network chains can be challenging. To address this, we introduce FACTIONS to establish hierarchy and organization.

#### What Are FACTIONS?

Factions represent the MAJOR blockchains that are well-established and widely recognized in the industry. These blockchains have significant popularity and large user bases. In contrast, minor blockchains are typically newer, smaller, or underutilized networks seeking to increase their visibility and adoption.

#### Relations Between MAJOR (FACTION) and MINOR Blockchains

* **Competition**: Major blockchains will compete with other major blockchains, and minor blockchains will compete within their own division. This separation prevents imbalances due to the significant gap in demand and resources between major and minor blockchains.
* **Collaboration**: Major blockchains and minor blockchains collaborate for mutual benefit. Major blockchains rely on minor blockchains for support and cooperation, creating a symbiotic relationship that enhances the success and sustainability of both parties.

By implementing this structure, STAR-EX ensures efficient resource management and fosters a vibrant, competitive, and cooperative gaming ecosystem. This approach allows us to create a balanced and exciting experience for all network participants.&#x20;
