# Staking System \[WIP]

### EXPEDITION STAKING&#x20;

The game introduces Expedition Staking as a means of rewarding players for their participation and contribution to the ecosystem. Through Expedition Staking, players stake their NFT Starships to receive rewards in TGEM tokens. These rewards are calculated based on the rarity and experience level of the staked Starship NFTs, with higher-tier and more experienced Starships yielding greater rewards. To ensure longevity and sustainability within the game ecosystem, the reward distribution system is carefully designed to balance player progression and ecosystem growth. Rewards are regulated based on the Tier and Experience of the staked NFTs, with payouts distributed over longer periods of time. This approach incentivizes both new and veteran players to actively participate in Expedition Staking, contributing to the long-term development and success of the game. Furthermore, as the game generates ongoing revenue, a portion of these revenues will be allocated to the staking reward pool. This additional contribution further enhances the rewards available to players participating in Expedition Staking, reinforcing the symbiotic relationship between gameplay, revenue generation, and ecosystem development.

### EXPEDITION POOL UNLOCKING&#x20;

In crafting our staking model for Starship NFTs, we prioritized maintaining a balance between scalability and sustainable growth within our ecosystem. We've observed the pitfalls of projects that either scale too rapidly, risking reward exhaustion, or move too cautiously, risking failure to launch. Our aim is to navigate this delicate balance effectively, ensuring that the early adoption advantage is not overly skewed towards early players, but rather distributed fairly among all participants. We recognize the potential unfairness of a scenario where a single player, possessing a higher-tier Starship NFT, dominates the staking pool, leaving others with little opportunity for participation. To address this, we've implemented a nuanced system where only a portion of the staking pool is distributed if there is an insufficient number of stakers. This approach encourages a more gradual and inclusive buildup of participation, allowing each player the chance to progress and reap rewards in proportion to their investment and commitment to the game.

The goal is to avoid both rapid scaling that exhausts rewards too quickly and too slow scaling that risks the project not launching successfully. Aiming to balance the distribution of rewards so that early adopters don't take everything, leaving nothing for later players.
