# Incentivized Crafting

In any game, economy revolves around incentives. STAR-EX is about uncovering mysteries, crafting those mysteries, and surviving with them. Even without cryptocurrency, many games have already incentivized players. For example, Counter-Strike has skin asset trading, and RPG games like RF-Online have had massively hard farming and exclusive items from crafting being sold for nearly 20 years.

STAR-EX aims to design an innovative economy by drawing from various games to create unique economic systems and drive certain acquisitions. Much of the asset economy is explained in the resources control section and factions.

Our crafting system forms a pivotal component of the game's ecosystem, offering players the opportunity to transform raw materials into valuable assets, consumables, or enhancements. Through a seamless integration of in-game mechanics and blockchain technology, the crafting system enables players to harness the potential of NFT materials found within the game environment.

**Material Acquisition:** Players gather NFT materials through exploration gameplay. These materials serve as the building blocks for crafting various in-game items, abilities, and starships.

**Versatile Crafting:** The crafting system allows players to combine materials to create consumable items, powerful abilities, or upgrade their starships and skins. This versatility empowers players to customize their gameplay experience and enhance their survivability in the game world.

**Marketplace Integration:** The crafted items can be traded on the in-game marketplace, providing opportunities for players to monetize their crafting endeavors. Additionally, players can purchase materials from the marketplace to supplement their crafting needs, fostering a dynamic player-driven economy.
