# NFT Selling

In our asset selling strategy, we aim to provide players with diverse and compelling options to acquire in-game assets, including starships, materials, abilities, and more. Our approach ensures a balanced and engaging economy while offering opportunities for both strategic planning and spontaneous acquisition.&#x20;

New NFT assets will be released periodically based on LORE STORY of the game with careful consideration surrounding the inflationary impact of release. Analysis of current demands for assets by new players, growth in user-adoption, asset availability on NFT marketplaces, and the natural deflation of assets resulting from high-risk cross-chain engagements will be conducted prior to the release of a new network of assets. All efforts will be undertaken to reduce negative impacts to players and asset holders resulting from these future sales.
