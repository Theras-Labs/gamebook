# Token Burn \[WIP]

This mechanism implemented by the STAREX development team to serves multiple purposes within the game ecosystem. By participating in token acquisition and subsequent burning, the team aims to contribute towards the Ultimate Acquired Market Maker (UAMM) while also creating deflation in the circulating supply of TGEM tokens. These token repurchases will occur on open-market decentralized exchanges (DEXs), ensuring transparency and accessibility for all players.

The repurchase curve is structured around two distinct business segments: standard revenues and in-game revenues. Standard revenues encompass income generated from the initial acquisition of assets by the developer, while in-game revenues consist of expenses paid in TGEM by players engaged in gameplay. This dual approach ensures a steady inflow of tokens into the burn mechanism, further reducing the circulating supply and potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens.
