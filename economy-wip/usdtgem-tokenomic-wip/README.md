# $TGEM Tokenomic \[WIP]

STAREX integrates Theras Protocol's robust tokenomics into its gameplay mechanics, leveraging TGEM to facilitate discount purchases and reward players for their participation. The tokens play a crucial role in driving the in-game economy and ensuring a rewarding experience for all players. Some features are only accessible with one of them, while others offer a discounted price when both are utilized

TGEM serves as crypto token designed to grow alongside the in-game economy. With a total supply of 8.8 billion units, TGEM's inflatable nature allows its monetary mass to expand in line with the game's economic growth. Offering cross-chain compatibility with major blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Polkadot, Solana, StarkNet L2, and Polygon, TGEM provides players with unparalleled flexibility and utility. While both TGEM and TGOLD are accepted within the STAREX game, TGEM offers additional benefits, including rewards from staking activities and enhanced cross-chain functionality.
