In our lore, STAR represents the source of an unknown mystical power and energy. Unlike the sun, this STAR can take any form. It's not a god, nor a creature, so what is it? Is it a resource? A material? A living entity? Through gameplay, players will gradually discover the true nature of the STAR, shaping their own understanding of it. To truly grasp its essence, you need to connect and play, as the storytelling and lore will guide you.

Then what about "EX"? It's definitely better than your ex :)\
but in our context, EX can mean many things:\
exploration, excitement, existence, expeditions, or even experience.\
It depends on your play style and excitement. We intentionally leave it open-ended to spark imagination and foster cross-ideas that break conventional boundaries.

STAR-EX is a game set in a vast, mysterious, and elegantly designed universe, inviting players to embark on a journey of discovery and adventure.
