# Asset Crafting

The crafting system is one of our key features that we are excited to share it as open source too later.\
In STAR-EX, every NFT can be crafted, from simple rocks (which may require destroying planets) to entire planets themselves (requiring significant resources and high-tier components like those from the Deity tier).

This crafting system is essential for players to advance their levels and progress in the game. Players can create better ships, enhance their abilities, or craft superior dungeons to obtain better materials.

To craft, players must have an outpost zone, or zone that offer crafting system, each with its own tier system. Players need to craft items of the same tier within the corresponding tier craft-zone to ensure a high probability of success.\


The crafting fee will be small and negligible, as the game aims to encourage players to engage in crafting. Initially, the crafting fee will be paid using each network's native token. We are considering using AI to balance the game's levels more effectively and manage the required components. Additionally, players can engage in cross-crafting using NFTs from different blockchain networks. While the cross-crafting system is partially off-chain for now, we plan to implement ChainLink CCIP for some events in the future. Crafting will consume several items and burn all the NFTs involved, so players should ensure they have the necessary materials prepared before attempting to craft.
