# Everything is NFT

In the world of STAR-EX, everything is an NFT. Whether it's a zone, the gameplay, the HUD, or abilities, everything will be represented as NFTs. Each NFT has its own tier, ranging from Tier 1 to Tier 7. The tiers are as follows:

* Common
* Uncommon
* Rare
* Epic
* Legendary
* Cosmic
* Deity

\
The "Deity" tier might be so exclusive that only the founder or the leader of a faction could attain it, as it will come with its own incentive program. The supply of NFTs will be distributed using a resource control system, ensuring balanced and sustainable economic growth within the game. For more details on how NFTs are managed. \<NFT Economic section>.

List of MAIN NFTs on PHASE 1:

* SHIPS&#x20;
* ZONES
