# WHY NFT?

As we progress into the next generation of gaming, with economic systems similar to the Steam marketplace and fungible assets, the management of digital assets has become increasingly complex and redundant. Players spend money in different games without the ability to resell seamlessly or move their assets outside of the game's ecosystem. With STAR-EX, as we embrace cross gameplay styles and diverse world settings, NFTs play a key role.\


NFTs will enable seamless integration of events from other games and provide unique approaches to gameplay and monetization. This means STAR-EX welcomes integration using assets from other games \<check cross-airdrop>. Players will be able to craft, trade, and utilize NFTs across different game worlds, creating a richer and more interconnected gaming experience. This approach not only enhances asset management but also offers players more flexibility and value for their in-game assets, while fostering collaboration with other protocols, games, systems, and projects more than ever before.
